## 3. Training A-FINE
### 3.1 Stage 1
In this stage, we will train the naturalness term and finetune the CLIP model for A-FINE. The training datasets include DiffIQA, KADID10K, PIPAL and TID2013. The training command is as follows, which is also written in ```demo.sh```

```bash
cd TrainAFINE/
### For single GPU training
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
python ./basicsr/train.py -opt ./options/train/AFINE/train_AFINE_stage1_nlogn.yml --auto_resume

### For DDP training

python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=3 --master_port=1234 ./basicsr/train.py -opt ./options/train/AFINE/train_AFINE_stage1_nlogn.yml --launcher pytorch --auto_resume
```

                    mode: 'Original'
                    finetune_CLIP_path: experiments/pretrained_models/AFINE_stage1_nlogn/clip_model.pth
```
You are supposed to download the pretrained CLIP ViT-b-32.pt model, and you should also indicate the finetuned CLIP path.


### 3.3 Stage 3
In this stage, we will train the non-linear mapping and adaptive term for A-FINE. The training datasets include DiffIQA,  KADID10K, PIPAL and TID2013. 
As for CLIP backbone, we directly load the finetuned clip_model.pth from Stage 1 and just fix its parameters. 
As for the naturalness term, we directly load the well-trained net_qhead.pth from Stage 1 and just fix its parameters. 
As for the fidelity term, we directly load the well-trained net_dhead.pth from Stage 2 and just fix its parameters. 

#### 3.3.1 Give reasonable initial values for the non-linear mapping function
Due to the excessively wide range of naturalness term, we need to give a reasonable inital value for $\gamma_{3}, \gamma_{4}$ (in Equation.8 in our main paper), so as to accelerate the convergence of the training progress, through a speific fitting strategy. We fit the initial value on the training parts of PIPAL dataset. Here are two steps you need to do,

(1). Normalize the original MOS scores of PIPAL to $(-2, 2)$
```bash
cd TrainAFINE/scripts/fit_parameter/normalize_mos
python normalize_PIPAL_mos.py --input_path [path to the original MOS scores provided by us] --save_path [path to your save path]
```
This step will save the normalized MOS scores to your save path.

(2). Fit the initial value of $\gamma_{3}, \gamma_{4}$
```bash
cd TrainAFINE/scripts/fit_parameter/fit_beta
python fit_beta_AFINE_Stage1.py [please change the argument parameters according to your own path]
```
This step will output the initial value.

Note that, for the initial value of $\eta_{3}, \eta_{4}$ in fidelity terms (in Equation.7 in our main paper), since the range of fidelity term is $(0, 1)$, we don't need to fit them on other datasets. Instead, we just set $\eta_{3} = 0.5, \eta_{4} = 0.15$.

#### 3.3.2 Train Stage 3
The training command is as follows, which is also written in ```demo.sh```

```bash
cd TrainAFINE/
### For single GPU training
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
python ./basicsr/train.py -opt ./options/train/AFINE/train_AFINE_stage3_nlogn.yml --auto_resume

```

in ```options/train/AFINE/train_AFINE_stage3_nlogn.yml```, you need to modify the training dataset settings ,validation dataset settings, the pretrained CLIP ```ViT-b-32.pt``` model, the finetuned ```clip_model.pth``` model which is trained in Stage 1, the pretrained naturalness term in Stage1, the pretrained fidelity term in Stage 2:

You are supposed to download the pretrained CLIP ```ViT-b-32.pt model``` and the finetuned ```clip_model.pth```.



The well-trained fidelity term:
```bash
(line 153)  path_dhead:
                pretrain_network_dhead: experiments/pretrained_models/AFINE_stage2_nlogn/net_dhead.pth
                strict_load_dhead: True
                param_key_dhead: params
```
You are supposed to download the well-trained ```net_dhead.pth```.



### 2.3 Stage 3
In this stage, we will test the whole A-FINE model on different testing datasets include SRIQA-Bench, DiffIQA, KADID10K, PIPAL and TID2013. The testing command is as follows, which is also written in ```demo.sh```

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
python ./basicsr/test.py -opt ./options/test/AFINE/test_AFINE_stage3_nlogn.yml
```

in ```options/test/AFINE/test_AFINE_stage3_nlogn.yml```, you need to modify the testing dataset settings, the pretrained CLIP ```ViT-b-32.pt``` model and the finetuned ```clip_model.pth```, the naturalness term, the fidelity term, the non-linear mapping and adaptive term:

Testing dataset settings:
```bash
(line 7)    test_1:
                name: SRIQA-Bench-All
                type: SRIQADataset
                all_img_path: /home/notebook/data/group/chendu/dataset/SRIQA-Bench/images
                all_score_path: /home/notebook/data/group/chendu/dataset/SRIQA-Bench/MOS
                io_backend:
                type: disk
                use_hflip: false
                use_rot: false
                mean: [0.48145466, 0.4578275, 0.40821073]
                std: [0.26862954, 0.26130258, 0.27577711]
...
```
You are supposed to indicate the image paths and triplet information of DiffIQA, KADID10K, PIPAL and TID2013. For SRIQA-Bench, you need to indicate the image paths and the MOS score path. For more details, please refer to this [instruction](datasets/README.md) to prepare the training datasets.

## 5. Train CLIP-DISTS on KADID-10k JSONL

The KADID-10k full-reference experiment reuses the Stage 2 training framework and
`AFINEDhead`, but each sample contains only a reference image, a distorted image,
and its MOS.  Train, validation, and test splits are supplied as separate JSONL
files.  In each record the first image in the user content is the reference, the
second is the distorted image, and the assistant text is parsed as a floating
point MOS.

Edit `jsonl_path`, `image_root`, and the ViT-B/16 checkpoint path in
`options/train/DISTS/train_CLIP_DISTS_KADID10K.yml`, then run:

```bash
cd TrainAFINE
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python basicsr/train.py \
  -opt options/train/DISTS/train_CLIP_DISTS_KADID10K.yml --auto_resume
```

For distributed training, use the same launcher as Stage 2:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python -m torch.distributed.launch \
  --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=1234 basicsr/train.py \
  -opt options/train/DISTS/train_CLIP_DISTS_KADID10K.yml \
  --launcher pytorch --auto_resume
```

After setting the test JSONL and trained `net_dhead` paths, evaluate with:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python basicsr/test.py \
  -opt options/test/DISTS/test_CLIP_DISTS_KADID10K.yml
```

MOS is assumed to lie in `[1, 5]` and to be higher-is-better.  These assumptions
are configurable under `score`.  The model converts MOS to a distance target for
training, while validation reports quality-oriented SRCC, PLCC, KRCC, and RMSE
over the complete split.  PLCC and RMSE use the standard five-parameter logistic
mapping by default.
